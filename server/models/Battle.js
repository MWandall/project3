// not sure if this model is needed, need to decide how we would use this if/ if it should exist
// my initial thought is that this is where we could store data about the npcs that the player is battling against,
//  but that could maybe just be included in the monster model, I think it depends if there will be any differences between what the player can do and what the npc does.
